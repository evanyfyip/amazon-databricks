# Project Name: amazon-databricks

## Description
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of an Amazon dataset onto Azure Databricks using Spark, enabling data analysis and performing various queries on the dataset. 

The Amazon dataset used in this project contains information about products, customers, and reviews. By leveraging Azure Databricks and Spark, we can efficiently process and analyze this large-scale dataset, gaining valuable insights and answering key questions.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-databricks.git
   ```

2. Set up Azure Databricks:
   - Create an Azure Databricks workspace.
   - Set up a Databricks cluster with Spark.

3. Import the dataset:
   - Download the Amazon dataset
     - Dataset: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html
     - Metadata: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon-meta.html
   - Process the amazon dataset locally using `process_amz_data.ipynb`
   - Upload the dataset to Azure Databricks, either by using the Databricks UI or programmatically.

4. Import the Databricks notebooks:
   - Create a new notebook in Azure Databricks.
   - Import the notebooks provided in this repository.

5. Configure the notebook:
   - Update the notebook code to point to the correct dataset location.
   - Modify any required settings or parameters according to your requirements.

6. Run the notebook:
   - Execute the cells in the notebook to load the dataset, perform data analysis, and run queries.

## Usage
After following the installation steps, you can use the notebooks to explore and analyze the Amazon dataset using Spark on Azure Databricks. Modify and execute the code cells as needed to perform your desired analysis and queries.

The notebook provides a step-by-step guide and documentation to assist you in understanding and customizing the code for your specific use case.

## Analysis
In this project, we perform various tasks on the Amazon dataset, such as:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
- Data Modeling: Processing the raw amazon data into a structured format
- Investigation: Perform various queries to gain insight about the amazon data

## Queries
We leverage the power of Spark to run complex queries on the Amazon dataset. Some example queries you can perform include:

- Retrieve top-rated products or best-selling items.
- Identify customers who have given the most reviews or have the highest ratings.
- Analyze trends over time, such as the number of reviews per month or sales per category.
- Find products with the most positive/negative sentiment based on customer reviews.
- Perform customer segmentation based on various criteria like demographics, purchase history, etc.

Feel free to customize the queries or create new ones based on your specific analysis goals.
